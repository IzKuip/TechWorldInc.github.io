    <p>ArcOS is a super advanced virtual desktop environment made in Electron. It has been in<br>
        development since February 17th, 2021, and the ArcOS team is working day in day out to make <br>
        ArcOS the best we possibly can. It has a modular application loading system, allowing you to<br>
        load your own applications, themes, many built-in applications to get you started which include<br>
        a file manager, terminal (ArcTerm), notepad, App Manager, Settings, and more, ready to assist you.<br>
        ArcOS is built using Electron, making it even more advanced than it could've been. The current<br>
        supported operating systems that ArcOS can run on are Windows and Linux. This doesn't mean it<br>
        won't run on MacOS, this only means that we haven't tested the functionality of ArcOS under the<br>
        conditions of MacOS.<br><br>
